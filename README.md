## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Susan, a current junior at Stony Brook University studying Computer Science. As student on the CS Honors track program, my courses have provided me with a solid foundation in software engineering, object-oriented programmng, and algorithms as well as skills in Java, C, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React. My undergraduate experience has been nothing but a journey of rewarding challenges (and coffee). My area of interests are software engineering, AI, and machine learning. 

## Current side-quests
Technical: Looking to increase my technical skillset and gain a real-world tech internship experience! 
Non-technical: Finish my endless list of manhuas/webtoons 


## I'm currently learning ...
AI, machine learning, and data science as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow at Cornell Tech! I'm building ML models
