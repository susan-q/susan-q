## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Susan, a current junior at Stony Brook University studying Computer Science. As a student on the CS Honors track program, my courses have provided me with a solid foundation in software engineering, object-oriented programming, and algorithms as well as skills in Java, C, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React. My undergraduate experience has been nothing but a journey of rewarding challenges (and coffee). 

My areas of interest include software engineering, AI, and machine learning, and I'm actively seeking a real-world tech internship to apply and grow my skills.

## I'm currently learning ...
AI, machine learning, and data science as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow at Cornell Tech! I'm building and analyzing ML models using tools such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and Keras.
